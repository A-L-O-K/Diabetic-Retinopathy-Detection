Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar levels.
The common types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, while type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance.
Common symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue.
Diabetes is typically diagnosed through blood tests measuring fasting blood glucose levels and/or HbA1c levels.
Type 2 diabetes can be managed through lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthy diet and exercising regularly, along with medications as prescribed by a healthcare professional.
Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells for energy.
Yes, diabetes can lead to complications like nerve damage, kidney problems, eye issues, and cardiovascular diseases.
Hypoglycemia can be treated by consuming a quick source of glucose, like fruit juice or glucose tablets.
Type 1 diabetes is not preventable, but type 2 diabetes can often be prevented or delayed through maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems.
Prolonged high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to leak or become blocked.
Symptoms may include blurred vision, floaters, difficulty seeing at night, and the appearance of dark spots or empty spaces in the vision.
Individuals with poorly controlled diabetes or long-standing diabetes are at higher risk.
Diabetic retinopathy can be diagnosed through a comprehensive eye examination, including dilation of the pupils to examine the retina.
Yes, if left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can progress and cause severe vision loss or blindness.
Treatment options include laser therapy to seal leaking blood vessels or injections of medication into the eye to reduce swelling and prevent new blood vessel growth.
Proper diabetes management, including controlling blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol, can help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy.
Yes, early detection and timely treatment can help prevent or delay vision loss.
Individuals with diabetes should have a comprehensive eye exam at least once a year to monitor for diabetic retinopathy and other eye-related complications.
