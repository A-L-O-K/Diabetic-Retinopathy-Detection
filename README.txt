# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
A model that predicts whetehr a person has diabetic rertinopathy or not


Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a debilitating eye condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide and poses a significant threat to their vision. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of DR are critical to prevent its progression and potential complications. In this research project, we present a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to predict whether a person has Diabetes retinopathy or not using retinal images. The model's primary objective is binary classification, distinguishing between patients with DR and those without the condition.

This program will predict the above thing.

There is a feature to ask question about diabetic retinopathy
